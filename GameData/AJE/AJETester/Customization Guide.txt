Quick and Dirty guideline to jet engine modeling

For example

	MODULE
	{
		name = AJEModuleFX		// this is for ModuleEnginesFX, for ModuleEngines use AJEModule
		IspMultiplier=1			// for Kerosene=1 IntakeAir=15, use 1/16=0.0625
		useOverheat=false 		// default value is true
		defaultentype=2   		// load default values for a type of engine
		acore=5.8   			// custom parameters
		byprat=0
		prat3=16
		tt4=2700
		tt7=4800
		abflag=1
		fhv=18600
		eta7=0.8
		tinlt=1200
		tfan=1500
		tcomp=2500
		
		
	}


1. Find out the max thrust (actually static thrust at sea level) with or without afterburner, and corresponding SFC
2. Find out compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature. If you cannot find it look for engines from the same era and similar design.
3. set tt4 and prat3, set abflag=0
4. adjust acore and efficiency coefficients to match max thrust and SFC without afterburner
5. set abflag=1 and adjust tt7 and eta7 to match thrust/SFC with afterburner

AJE Propeller example:

	MODULE
	{
		name=AJEPropeller                   
		IspMultiplier = 1		// same as jet
		useOxygen = true  		// for electric propellers use false
								// below five are reference parameters for definition of the propeller, they are by no means the actual airplane performance
		r0 = 1.75				// radius of propeller in meter
		v0 = 240   				//	cruise speed in knot               
		omega0 = 1157			// cruise rpm of propeller
		rho0 = 1				// cruise altitude air density in kg/m3
		power0 = 950			// cruise engine power in horsepower

//Some propellers have more thrust at low speed but are less efficient at high speed, some others are the opposite. Tweak the above parameters and try
		
		fine = 0.2				// these two are the max and min pitching control authority
		coarse = 5				// usually not so important. The pitching is done automatically

		omega = 1537			// max rpm
		power = 1795			// max engine power in Horsepower
		gearratio = 0.542		// gear ratio between the engine and the propeller, not important
		turbo = 3.1				// the bigger this is, the stronger a supercharger it has, hence better performance at high alt.

		BSFC = 7.62e-8			// SFC in kg/(W * s)

	}


The algorithm is copied from YASim program, which is one of the flight models of an open-source flight simulator "FlightGear". So the easiest way is to check if there are ready-made propellers from FlightGear community:

http://www.flightgear.org/download/aircraft-v3-0/

For example we downloaded Fw190, found fw190-yasim.xml in the zip file. In the file we look for:
<propeller   x="-1.2" y="0" z="-0.2"
           radius="1.75" 						//there's r0
           mass="2660" moment="84.5"
           cruise-alt="5000" cruise-power="950"			//cruise alt in meter, power in HP
           cruise-speed="240" cruise-rpm="1157"
           gear-ratio="0.542"
           min-rpm="300" max-rpm="1537" >		//max rpm
